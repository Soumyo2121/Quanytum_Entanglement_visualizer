# Quanytum_Entanglement_visualizer
It is used to visualize quantum entangle states of several qubits. Both partial and Fully entangled state.  
It takes no. of qubits and angle value of Rx or Ry gate as input. based on the angle value, it will show partial or fully entangled quantum state.  
To run it, At first download all the files in your device.  
Make sure you have flask installed on your computer.  
You can install flask using "pip install flask".
Then run command "python app.py" on terminal  
copy the link from the output and paste it in the browser
